> ## ðŸ“¦ Heads up: This repo is *archived*
> This repo was part of our earlier multi-repo setup for the WISdoM platform. 
> We're still modular in structure, but managing everything across multiple 
> repos, even with [`meta`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meta), was tough to 
> keep in sync.
>
> We've since consolidated the frontend into a single monorepo, which has made 
> things smoother, easier to maintain, and a lot faster to develop.
>
> Check out the [main `frontend` repo](https://github.com/wisdom-oss/frontend) 
> for the latest code, features, and where all active development is happening.
